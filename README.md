# WebStudio Markup Project

This project is part of the **GoIT Fullstack Development Course**. The goal is to create an HTML markup for the provided layout without applying CSS styling.

## Project Overview

- The main HTML file is named `index.html`.
- A dedicated `images` folder contains all required images.
- File names follow best practices: only lowercase letters, no spaces, no transliteration.
- Code formatting is done using **Prettier**.
- All text and images are taken directly from the provided design layout.
- Raster images are optimized using **Squoosh**.
- The code adheres to the best practices and course guidelines.

## Live Demo

The project is deployed via **GitHub Pages**. You can view the live version [here](https://kseniia-diak.github.io/goit-hw-01/)

## HTML Markup Requirements

### General Structure

- The `index.html` file contains the markup for the **Studio** page.
- The page structure includes all elements from the provided design layout.
- Semantic HTML tags are used where appropriate.
- The markup passes the **HTML validator** without errors.
- The primary page sections are structured using `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

### Header & Navigation

- The **logo** in the header and footer is a text link, not an image.
- The `<nav>` element is used only once in the header.
- Contact details (email and phone) are placed **outside** the `<nav>`.

### Content & Accessibility

- The page includes a single `<h1>` tag.
- The **“Order a Service”** element is a `<button>` with `type="button"`.
- Section headings are marked with `<h2>`.
- `<img>` tags include `width` attributes and `alt` descriptions.
- All images are exported in **.jpg** format.
- Groups of similar elements (e.g., navigation links, team members) are wrapped in `<ul>` lists.
- The `<address>` tag is used **only** in the footer.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for markup
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Squoosh** for image optimization
